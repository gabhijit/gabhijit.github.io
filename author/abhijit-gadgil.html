In particular we are looking at how <code>pipenv</code> will help us solve the problems of reproducible builds and managing dev and production environments properly.</p> <a class="btn btn-info xsmall" href="/python-project-workflows-2.html">read more</a></div>

        <div class="summary"><p>In a Python based development, tools like <code>pylint</code>, <code>pipenv</code> and <code>virtualenv</code> become important pieces of your development workflow. In the first part of the series of blog posts, we look at overview of the issues that become important as the scope of the project and size of the team working on project increases. In later posts in these series, we would try to address these issues one by one, we look at starting a project, identifying and resolving dependencies 'correctly', why reproducible builds matter, how to separate development and production environment and eventually how to containerize the application.</p> <a class="btn btn-info xsmall" href="/python-project-workflows-1.html">read more</a></div>

        <div class="summary"><p><a href="http://www.openairinterface.org/">OpenAirInterface</a> aims to develop open source software solutions for 4G and 5G cellular network, that would run on COTS hardware (typically x86/ARM based CPUs). The project provides an Air Interface Simulator (OAISIM) and implementations of eNodeB and the EPC. OAISIM allows one to test the software implementations of the Network components, without actually having access to the RF part. While there are many tutorials that allow you to connect OAISIM + eNodeB on one machine and connect it with EPC (MME/SGW and PGW) running on another machine, I was not able to find any good tutorial that allowed to connect these devices on the same machine. While, it's quite possible to do so by using two VMs on the same machine, two VMs still looked like sub-optimal as in theory it looked quite possible to do this using Network Namespaces to provide isolations for individual nodes. Further, using network namespaces would allow to containerize this quite easily. Since the development platform I am using is not exactly identical to the one for which documentation is available, I had to do some tweaking to build the components as well. This blog post discusses this in details.</p> <a class="btn btn-info xsmall" href="/oai-oaisim-enb-epc-netns.html">read more</a></div>

        <div class="summary"><p>Profiling your code to identify hotspots or potential performance issues can prove quite useful. Python provides a <code>cProfile</code> package in the standard library provides this functionality for deterministic profiling. Usually, one might want to have an ability to turn profiling on and off at the run-time if possible. We explore a mechanism based on context managers in Python (Python <code>with</code> syntax) to be able to do so.</p> <a class="btn btn-info xsmall" href="/python-profiling-context-manager.html">read more</a></div>

I worked with two flavors and the findings for different data-sets are quite interesting. Something that would definitely qualify as an interesting learning.
