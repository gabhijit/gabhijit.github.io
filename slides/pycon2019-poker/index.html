### Game of Poker - Quick Intro
--
There are many variations of Poker games, we'll look at most common variant called Texas hold'em.

Poker is a card game involving multiple players -

1. Each pair is dealt two cards initially.
2. Then there are cards called community cards, total of 5. Those cards are revealed as follows -
  - Three community cards are revealed first (called 'flop')
  - Then one more community card is revealed (called 'turn')
  - Finally last community card is revealed (called 'river')
--
3. At each of the above rounds, players bet, in a round-robin manner.
4. Another player can 'Call' a player's bet or 'Raise' a player's bet or 'Fold'.
5. At each stage, all players' bets should be equal.
6. Player with highest bet or the best hand wins.

---
### Poker Hands - Overview

1. Each Poker hand is made up of 5 cards.
2. Using any combination of Player's own cards or community cards (most variations differ in this aspect)
3. The hands are ranked based on their odds, one with lower odds is ranked highest

### Okay Some Python now!

We'll first start with representing a card, a deck and hands.
--
Representing Cards (ideas borrwoed from [Peter Norvig's code](http://norvig.com))

 * Each Card has got a 'Rank' and a 'Suite'.
 * Ranks from 1 (for Ace) to 13 for (King) but actually we use 2 to 14 (for Ace)
 * Suits are Spade, Heart, Diamond, Club.
 * Thus we can represent a card as Rank+Suite - '2S', 'AD' , 'QC' etc.
 * Also, for every 'Rank', we'll assign a value (some notion of Score of that card).

--
Thus our Deck now will look like -

```python
suits = ['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']
cardranks = {'2':2, '3':3, '4':4, '5':5, '6':6, '7':7, '8':8,
        '9': 9, 'T': 10, 'J':11, 'Q':12, 'K': 13, 'A': 14}


def deck(shuffled=False):
    d =  [''.join((rank, suit)) for suit in suits \
            for rank in cardranks]
    if shuffled:
        random.shuffle(d)
    return d


```
--
Poker Hands are just - A list of 5 cards - Some Examples

```python
# Flush (All Spades)
flush = ['AS', 'JS', '9S', '6S', '2S']

# Full House (2 Aces and 3 Kings)
full_house = ['AS', 'AD', 'KC', 'KD', 'KH']

# High Card (Ace High)
high_card = ['AS', 'QC', '9D', '7C', '4H']

```
---
#### Comparing Poker Hands

We'll start by defining a class called 'PokerHand' and then use operator overloading for comparison.

Strictly, there's no need to 'force' to use a class here, but this comes in handy

--
```python
class BasePokerHand:

    ...
    def __init__(self):
        """ ranks, suits as separate lists from the cards.
          ordered, is a list of (rank, count) tuples,
          useful in tie-breaker.
        """
        self._cards = None,
        self._suits = None,
        self._ranks = None,
        self._ordered = []
    ...
```
--

We'll need to determine 'type' of a hand.

Some ways in which we can determine 'type' of a hand -

1. If All the cards are of same suite, it's a flush, this we can represent in python as
```python
len(set(suits)) == 1
```
2. '4 Of a Kind' and 'Full House' will have at the most 2 ranks (4A-1K or 3A-2K)
```python
len(set(ranks)) == 2
```
3. If it's a 'Straight' difference between max rank and minimum rank is 4
```python
max(ranks) - min(ranks) == 4
```
--
```python
class PokerHand(BasePokerHand):
  ...
    def flush(self):
        return len(set(self._suits)) == 1

    def straight(self):

        return len(set(self._ranks)) == 5 and \
                max(self._ranks) - min(self._ranks) == 4 or \
                (len(set(self._ranks)) == 5 and \
                    max(self._ranks) == 14 and \
                    sum(self._ranks) == 28)

    def straight_flush(self):
        return self.flush() and self.straight()

    ...
```
--
```python
    ...
    def four_of_a_kind(self):
        return len(set(self._ranks)) == 2 and \
                self.ordered[0][1] == 4

    def full_house(self):
        return len(set(self._ranks)) == 2 and \
                self.ordered[0][1] == 3 and \
                self.ordered[1][1] == 2

    def three_of_a_kind(self):
        return len(set(self._ranks)) == 3 and \
                self.ordered[0][1] == 3

    ...
```
--
```python
    ...
    def two_pairs(self):
        return len(set(self._ranks)) == 3 and \
               self.ordered[0][1] == 2

    def pair(self):
        return len(set(self._ranks)) == 4

    ...
```
--
Once we find out type, of a hand, we'll find the score of a hand and then compare the hands using their scores.

But we also need to break ties when scores are same, where this `ordered` comes into play.
--
Closer look at 'Ordered'

`ordered` is a list of tuples of the type (rank, count) sorted, by count first and rank later.

```python
    def ordered(self):
        if self._ordered:
            return self._ordered

        rank_counts = list(set([(i, self._ranks.count(i)) \
                for i in self._ranks]))
        return sorted(rank_counts, key=itemgetter(1, 0),
                reverse=True)
```
--
This Serves as a tie-breaker. Let's take some examples -

```python
1. 'HA', 'SA', 'S8', 'C8', 'H8'  - # ordered = [(8,3), (14,2)]
2. 'HA', 'SA', 'CA', 'S6', 'H6'  - # ordered = [(14,3), (6,2)]
```
Thus hand 2 is better than hand one, even though both are 'full house' hands.
(Trivia: Both hands above are from the movie 'Casino Royale')
--
Finally the comparison operator
```python
    def __lt__(self, other):
        if self.score < other.score: return True
        if self.score > other.score: return False

        for a, b in zip(self.ordered, other.ordered):
            if a[0] < b[0]:
                return True
            if a[0] > b[0]:
                return False

```
--
So far we have looked at comparing Poker hands, now we'll look at simulating Poker Games.

---
#### Simulating a Single Poker Game

1. A poker game consists of a Table, with given number of Players
2. Each player is initially dealt two cards, we call it 'deal'
3. To simulate a Poker Game, we need -
   - Shuffled Deck
   - Number of Players
   - Each Player's initial hand (we call it MiniPokerHand)
   - And actions like 'flop', 'turn', 'river'
--

We keep some additional state for a game, this state includes

1. Which player had the best hand during initial 'deal'
2. Which player had the best hand after 'flop', 'turn' respectively
3. Which player had the best hand
4. Also, things like, how many 'pairs' were there in initial deals or Ace Highs or Cards of Same suite.

This state will be useful when we run simulations and want to find out answers
--
As we see there are different stages of a game (at each stage, players on the table Bet)

At each stage, we need to Rank Players. Let's look at how it's done
--
```python
def rank_players(self, pre_flop=False):

    player_hands = {}
    if pre_flop:

        for i, player in enumerate(self._players):
            player_hands[i] = MiniPokerHand.from_str( \
                    " ".join(player.own_cards))
            if max(player_hands[i].ranks) == 14:
                self._ace_high_players.append(i)
            if player_hands[i].score == 2:
                self._pair_players.append(i)
            if len(set(player_hands[i].suits)) == 1:
                self._mini_flush_players.append(i)
    ...
```
--
```python
    ...
    else:
        for i, player in enumerate(self._players):
            possible_hands = []
            for c in combinations(self._community_cards, 3):
                hand = player.own_cards + list(c)
                possible_hands.append(PokerHand.from_str(\
                        " ".join(hand)))
            player_hands[i] = sorted(possible_hands,
                    reverse=True)[0]

    players = (sorted(player_hands.items(),
        key=lambda kv:kv[1], reverse=True))

    for i in range(len(players)):
        player_id = players[i][0]
        self._table_ranks[i] = player_id

```
--
So a single game would look like -
```python
    def run_one_game(self):

        self.deal()
        self.rank_players(pre_flop=True)
        self._deal_winner = self._table_ranks[0]

        self.burn_card()
        self.flop()
        self.rank_players()
        self._flop_winner = self._table_ranks[0]

        self.burn_card()
        self.turn()
        self.rank_players()
        self._turn_winner = self._table_ranks[0]

        self.burn_card()
        self.river()
        self.rank_players()
        self._river_winner = self._table_ranks[0]

        self._pot_winner = self._river_winner


```

#### Simulating a large number of games

1. We are interested in finding out whether there are any interesting statistics in Poker
2. We just need a driver for the above code.
